Stores necessary files for the Coursera "Getting &amp; Cleaning Data" course project


This project uses a data set gathered from Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, described here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The data set to be used with the run_analysis.R script was downloaded from here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The run_analysis.R script contained in this repository requires 1 of the two following file configurations to work:

The getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip file initially downloaded from the data set URL above must be present in the working directory 
(i.e. the same directory as run_analysis.R)

OR

The unmodified directory/file structure that results from unzipping the getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip file should be 
present in the working directory.  This means the root folder (UCI HAR Dataset) should be in the same directory as run_analysis.R
and rest of the subdirectory/file structure should be unchanged from how unzip extracted them.
